Mariam-code-refactoring
What problems i solved?
This is a website, Where I refactor the website so all of the application's links functioned correctly. For example, to make images load correctly on the website, I added images by linking the folder that contains the correct images and linked each image on the index.html the correct way, and the background images used on the front website I linked that particular images on the style.css. Also for the sub-images, two were on the left side of the website and one was on the right I had to fix the search engine image to go on the left side by adding "class=float-left" because the content wasn't structured properly. For the navigation header to work when you press it so it takes you to the exact information you need. I added a class ID to the search engine div so it can be referenced and linked to navigation header. I also added apporiate styles to the website to make structure better.
what did i learn? 
how to refactor the website to function correctly and to spot the mistakes that completely chnages the structure of the website incorrectly.
